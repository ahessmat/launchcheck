# launchcheck

## TODO:
-Implement a method for ingesting TLE data
-Implement a means for specifying/plotting launch destination
-Restrict plots of debris to only those that pose risk to launch site/time
-Create server that independently queries for TLE data and serves to test.py; this will speed up performance
